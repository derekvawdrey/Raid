# Raid
## Factions rethought

This plugin was a proof of concept that was created to make a somewhat more permanent "factions" server. In this plugin, factions can declare war on each other, and blow up bases using special tools. After a raid is over, chests will be looted, and everything will automatically rebuild over a certain period of time.

This is a proof of concept, so not everything was implemented, but the base works. You are free to build on this plugin and make it what you want.

## What was implemented?
- Raiding commands
- Special TNT
- Block replacement, allows replacing blocks at a rather quick speed, when I tested it, it could handle 100,000+ blocks a second of replacing without lag.
